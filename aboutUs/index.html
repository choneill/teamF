			<h2>The Irish Motorcycle Tours Company</h2> <br><br><br>
			<h4><p align="justify">Lorem Ipsum. We would like to take you for a short trip thought time. Our company has a long history in Irish motorcycling communnity. </p>
			
			<p align="justify">Even though Steve Conrad planned to take off on a motorcycle tour of Ireland, by the time he set off with his wife Debbie to start the tour, the motorcycle had to go to make way for Debbie’s vehicle. While he was on the road, he found an old BMW R50/3 motorcycle parked outside a farmhouse. This would later be the base of operations for his travels.</p>

			<p align="justify">The Conrads traveled up and down the south and west coasts of Ireland, spending time in Galway, Donegal, Cork, Dublin and Shannon. In 1990, the couple returned to the UK for a short trip to purchase bicycles and tent equipment, then returned to Ireland in September. Their traveling adventure was only a few months, but the Conrad’s established themselves in Ireland as successful bicycle and motorcycle tour operators.</p>

			<p align="justify">The Conrad’s returned to England and established their own travel company in 1990. The Conrad’s established their company in 1990 with Steve as the owner of the company. From their first bike tour, the Conrad’s built up a solid business and business managed to remain profitable throughout the 1990’s. After the acquisition of a motorcycle company by BMW Motorrad in 1990, the Conrad’s began a trip around the world, taking advantage of the tour company expertise and resources.</p>

			<p align="justify">The motorcycle company that the Conrad’s purchased was associated with a motorcycle manufacturer established in Ireland called KTM. The Conrad’s were attracted to KTM because of their international reputation, as well as the relish of a motorcycle company based in Ireland. KTM had established themselves by opening dealerships in a number of countries around the world, including the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Australia and the UK. The acquisition of KTM, even if it was for only a loan of company funds, was a substantial addition to Steve’s company. Steve also noted that KTM established itself in Ireland before they established themselves in Europe, which is an established fact.</p>

			<p align="justify">Although the motorcycle market was booming in 1990, the motorcycle market had suffered from a downturn in the late 1980’s. However, with the financial troubles of many motorcycle manufacturers and dealerships, the motorcycle market had experienced a slump. One of the factors that contributed to the downturn in motorcycle sales in the 1980’s was a failure of people to invest in new motorcycles. The motorcycle market had suffered as a result of a lack of financing for new motorcycle purchases. This resulted in bike enthusiasts, and the public, using more petrol than necessary riding places around the entire country. Another factor contributing to the decline of motorcycle sales in the 1980’s was that bike dealerships that were established during the motorcycle boom had to purchase bikes that were in demand at the time. This caused sales to become unstable.</p>

			<p align="justify">Bike dealerships began buying their bikes later, and more expensive bikes than other buyers, creating more stock than consumers could afford to buy. More expensive bikes resulted in less competition and lower prices, making the process of shopping for a new business ideas.</p>

			<p align="justify">Eventually Patrick came up with an idea of establishing a motorcycle rental and touring company. For 30 years he worked as a businessman, mechanic, guide, and advisor to thousands of happy customers.</p>

			<p align="justify">Our company continues this tradition.</p><h4>
