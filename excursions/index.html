						<h2>The Wild Atlantic Way</h2>
						<p>Experience The Wild Atlantic Way on one of our touring motorcycles.</p>

						<p> At 2600 km in length, The Wild Atlantic Way is one of the longest defined coastal routes in the world. 
						It winds its way all along the Irish west coast from the Inishowen Peninsula in the north down to the picturesque town of Kinsale, County Cork, in the south. 
						This route from start to finish unfolds the wonders of nature, the power of the ocean and its imprint on the west coast of Ireland, and the stunning countryside in all its diversity. 
						Stop off at enchanting villages nestled along the coast or roll up to ancient monuments, their origins having long sunk into the mists of oblivion dot the landscape. 
						Behind every bend on this magical coastal road a new delight awaits.
			  			 </p>	
						 <p>
							The wild Atlantic with its unrestrained and untameable tides and storms has continuously been moulding the west coast of Ireland. 
							With a constant meeting of water and land, a deeply indented and wild terrain has emerged with towering cliffs, spellbinding bays and beaches, mystical islands, always changing and never reaching the end. 
							In the isolation or perhaps expressed in a different way living near and with the Atlantic at your doorstep has ensured that old traditions and the Irish language have been preserved. 
							A trip along the Wild Atlantic Way is also an encounter with the past.

						<h2>The Giants Causeway</h2>
						<p>Ride to the Giant's Causeway, Northern Ireland's only UNESCO World Heritage site. 
							This natural wonder makes a popular choice for a day trip, located along the scenic Antrim Coast Road. 
							This full-day tour from Belfast makes it possible to maximize your time, 
							combining a tour of the Giant's Causeway with visits to nearby attractions such as the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge, 
							Carrickfergus Castle and Dunluce Castle.
